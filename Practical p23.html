<p>    <b>Ancient India was home to the sophisticated Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500–2000 BCE) and later the Vedic period (c. 1500–500 BCE), during which the foundations of Hinduism were laid and the Indo-Aryan culture spread</b></p>
<p>    <u>By 600 BCE, states began to form, and by the 5th century CE, Ashoka unified the land, spreading Buddhism across Asia.</u></p>
<p>   <sub>Later, Islam arrived in the 8th century CE, eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which brought further political unity to the subcontinent. </sub>
<p>  <sup>Indus Valley Civilization:
This highly organized culture, originating in the Indus River valley (modern-day Pakistan and northwest India), flourished from about 2500 to 2000 BCE. It was characterized by sophisticated urban planning, advanced drainage systems, standardized weights, and a written script (yet to be deciphered). </sup></p>
<p><del>Vedic Period:
Following the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, Indo-Aryan tribes migrated into the Punjab from Central Asia, marking the beginning of the Vedic period (c. 1500–500 BCE). During this era, the extensive collections of hymns known as the Vedas were composed, laying the groundwork for Hindu traditions. </del></p>
<p>    <ins>Mauryan Empire:
In the 3rd century BCE, Ashoka, the first to unify India under a single rule, converted to Buddhism and helped spread the religion throughout Asia.</ins></p>
<p>    <pre>Arrival of Islam:
Islam first came to India in the 8th century CE, with a significant political presence established by the 11th century. This led to the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, a precursor to the Mughal Empire.</pre></p>
<p>   <mark>Mughal Empire:
This empire brought a large measure of political unity to India and was in place when Europeans first arrived in the 17th century.</mark></p>
<p> <kbd>European Influence
Decline of the Mughals and Rise of Regional States:
The disintegration of the Mughal Empire coincided with the arrival of Europeans, creating a power vacuum filled by regional states.</kbd> </p>  
<p> <dfn>English Supremacy:
In the struggle for dominance, the English emerged victorious. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a bid to restore Indian supremacy but was ultimately crushed, leading to the formal incorporation of India into the British Empire</dfn></p>
<p> <code>History is the study of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at things from the past including sources (like books, newspapers, scripts and letters), buildings and different types of artifacts (like pottery, tools, coins and human or animal remains.)</code></p>
<p> <q>The "Father of History" is Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian who is credited with being the first to systematically collect and document events, primarily the Greco-Persian Wars, in his seminal work, The Histories</q></p>
<p> <blockquote>History's importance lies in providing identity and understanding present issues by revealing their roots, offering lessons from past mistakes and achievements, fostering empathy and cultural understanding, developing critical thinking and analytical skills, preserving collective memory, enabling responsible citizenship through understanding national and international perspectives, and informing better decision-making for a more informed and responsible society. </blockquote></p>
