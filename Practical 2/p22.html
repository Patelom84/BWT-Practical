Processing: The Central Processing Unit (CPU), or "the brain" of the computer, executes the program's instructions by performing calculations and logical operations.
Output: After processing the data, the computer presents the results to the user through output devices like a monitor, speakers, or printer.
Storage: The computer can store data and instructions for future use in both temporary (RAM) and permanent (hard drive or SSD)0 memory.
