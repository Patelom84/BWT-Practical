    <h1>Morden Physics</h1>
    <pre>Modern physics is the branch of physics, starting around 1900, that explores the behavior of matter and energy at very large or very small scales, or at extreme speeds, which classical physics cannot fully explain. Its two main pillars are quantum mechanics, which describes the atomic and subatomic world, and the theory of relativity, which deals with the effects of high speeds and strong gravity on space and time. Key concepts in modern physics include wave-particle duality, the photoelectric effect, radioactivity, nuclear physics, and the famous mass-energy equivalence, E=mc².
Key Differences from Classical Physics
Scale:
Classical physics describes the macroscopic, everyday world (e.g., motion of objects), while modern physics deals with the microscopic world (atoms and subatomic particles) and phenomena involving extreme conditions.
Deterministic vs. Probabilistic:
Classical physics uses deterministic laws, but modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, introduces probabilistic principles.
Domains:
Modern physics explains phenomena like the photoelectric effect, atomic structure, and relativistic effects that classical physics cannot.
Major Branches
Quantum Mechanics: Examines matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.
Theory of Relativity: Studies the effects of high speeds and gravity on space, time, and motion.
Important Concepts
Photoelectric Effect: The emission of electrons when light hits a material, explained by Albert Einstein, who won the Nobel Prize for this.
Wave-Particle Duality: The concept that particles can also behave as waves, and vice-versa.
Mass-Energy Equivalence: Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², which shows that mass and energy are interchangeable.
Radioactivity: The study of alpha, beta, and gamma decay in nuclear physics.
